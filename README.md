# Automatic Guitar with Arduino and Servo Motors

This project demonstrates how to create an automatic guitar using Arduino and servo motors. By following this guide, you can build a simple musical instrument that plays predefined notes automatically. Feel free to customize and extend the project to create your own melodies or experiment with different servo configurations.

## Introduction

The automatic guitar project uses servo motors to strum the strings of a guitar, creating musical notes. The Arduino board controls the servo motors to generate specific frequencies, producing musical tones. In this example, we'll use servo motors to strum the guitar strings, but you can also experiment with other variations.

## Components Needed

1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. Servo motors (6 or more, depending on the number of strings)
3. Guitar or similar instrument (with strings)
4. Jumper wires
5. Breadboard (optional)
6. Power supply for servo motors

## Setup

1. **Install Arduino IDE:** If you haven't already, [download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) on your computer.

2. **Install Servo Library:** Open the Arduino IDE and go to **Sketch > Include Library > Servo**. This will allow you to control the servo motors.

3. **Connect Servo Motors:** Connect the servo motors to the Arduino board following the wiring diagram provided in the next section.

## Code

Upload the Arduino code provided in the files to your Arduino board. This code defines the servo motor positions for strumming and creates a simple melody.

## Usage

Once the code is uploaded to your Arduino board and the wiring is correctly set up, power on the system. The servo motors will start strumming the guitar strings, producing a melody.

You can adjust the servo motor positions and timing in the code to create different melodies or play specific songs.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and extend the project in various ways:

- **Melody:** Modify the code to play your favorite songs or melodies.
- **Servo Configuration:** Experiment with different servo motor configurations, such as adding more servos to control individual strings or using different types of servos.
- **Additional Instruments:** Incorporate other musical instruments or sensors to create a more complex musical setup.
